        My website is all about reviewing my favourite games. The website is intended to keep the minimalist design throughout the site to keep it consistent. All images except the homepage were captured on my PC and Playstation. Max Payne 3's background is a reward you obtain in the game. Far Cry 3 is a cutscene I took a photo of, and God of War is the loading background that you see when you launch the game on PS4. The homepage image is on a website called imgur whcih has images that are all free to use. This website has been tested for colourblind users and it works fine. My website is also able to be displayed on any device as it will automatically configure to the specified height and width.
