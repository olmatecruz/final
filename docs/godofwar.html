      <p>God of War is nothing short of a masterpeice. Before the most recent release God of War is a game that no one really took seriously. It was fun and filled violence. But with the recent release, they mastered nearly everything. The interesting and entertaing father/son dynamic is beautiful to watch unfold. The combat is incredibly cathartic and brutal. Every attack has a heavy feeling behind it which makes you more immersed in the game. Baldur as a villain is incredible. My only gripe with the game is that long puzzles and the annoying fast travel system can bog the pacing of the game to a grinding halt. Nevertheless still an amazing experience, 4.5/5
